COMPX234 - Lab Assignment 2
Readers-Writers Problem using a Monitor in Python

Starter code
------------
Complete the TODO sections to implement a correct monitor solution.

Rules:
1. Multiple readers may read together if no writer is writing.
2. A writer must have exclusive access.
3. Use the monitor methods only to control access.

After you finish:
- test the program,
- rename this file to readers_writers.py if required by your instructor,
- commit your work to GitHub with meaningful commit messages.
